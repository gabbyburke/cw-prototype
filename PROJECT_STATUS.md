## üìù **TOMORROW'S PICKUP PROMPT**

```
I'm continuing work on our modular CCWIS (Child Welfare Information System) prototype. 

CONTEXT: We've successfully built Olivia Rodriguez's frontline caseworker interface with beautiful mobile-first design, card-based case management, and complete CPS hotline to caseworker referral workflow. The system is running at http://localhost:3002.

NEXT PRIORITY: Build David Chen's CPS Intake Specialist interface. David is the first point of contact for CPS hotline calls and needs:

1. **Guided intake workflow** for processing calls step-by-step
2. **Real-time duplicate checking** to avoid duplicate cases
3. **Dynamic forms** that can handle multiple children/perpetrators
4. **Safety assessment prompts** with built-in risk evaluation
5. **Smart assignment routing** to appropriate caseworkers

The intake interface should create referrals that flow into Olivia's "New Referrals Assigned to You" section we just built.

Please start by creating David's intake dashboard and guided call processing workflow.
